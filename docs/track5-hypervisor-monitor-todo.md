# Track 5 — All-Vendor Hardware Separation Monitor (the irreducible-hardware tier)

Goal: provide the **two guarantees that software alone cannot** — and provide them
on **every virtualization-capable ISA** behind one vendor-neutral interface, so
NexusOS gets maximum hardware compatibility instead of being Intel-only. This is
the hardware half of `docs/The final goal after the rest.txt`. Everything in that
goal file that does NOT require hardware moves to **Track 6** (the compartmentalized
software "-1" monitor); this track is *only* the residual that genuinely needs
silicon.

The two irreducible-hardware guarantees (established in the Track 6 analysis):

- **G1 — Privilege below ring-0 (un-disableable floor).** A software monitor lives
  at the same privilege as the kernel it guards, so a compromised ring-0 can
  `clear CR0.WP` / rewrite CR3 / execute privileged instructions to disable it.
  Only a mode *beneath* ring-0 can trap those. This is what makes the Track 6
  compartments un-disableable rather than merely expensive-to-disable. (Also
  closes the existing nk_monitor SMP/AP gap where APs run with WP=0.)
- **G2 — Device-DMA confinement.** A malicious device DMAs straight to physical
  RAM, bypassing the CPU MMU entirely. Only an IOMMU can stop it. No CPU-side
  software substitute exists.

Per `architecture-defense-in-depth.md` design rule 3, this tier is **opportunistic**:
where the hardware exists it is detected and armed; where it does not (QEMU-TCG,
no-IOMMU boards, virt disabled in firmware) the system stays safe on the Track 6
software floor with the two residuals documented honestly. Hardware is hardening,
never a prerequisite for safety.

Maps to `docs/nhl-beyond-zero-trust-todo.md` → "P0: Compromised Kernel And
Hypervisor Containment" + Kill-Chain "opportunistic monitor/hypervisor tier".
Depends on Track 6 (the compartments are what this tier makes un-disableable) and
Track 2 (verify-before-map-executable).

## Honesty rule (non-negotiable)

Same discipline as Track 3. Maturity tags:

- `modeled` — code exists, logic exercised on host/compiler, fails closed.
- `tested-tcg` — exercised under QEMU **without** hardware virt (logic only:
  field encode/decode, page-table math, HAL dispatch). **Does NOT mean the
  hardware enforces anything** — TCG runs none of VMX-root / SVM / EL2 / H-mode.
- `tested-accel` — exercised where the relevant extension actually traps
  (KVM-nested, `-cpu host,+vmx/+svm`, ARM virt host, etc.).
- `tested-hw` — exercised on real silicon of that vendor.

We never claim hardware enforcement from a TCG boot, and never claim a vendor's
path works until it is at least `tested-accel` for that vendor. We never claim
safety after arbitrary total hardware compromise.

## Status legend
- [x] done at the stated maturity tag   [~] partial   [ ] not started

## The vendor-neutral monitor HAL (do this FIRST — it is the compatibility story)

Everything below plugs into one abstract interface so the rest of NexusOS, and
all of Track 6, are vendor-agnostic. Adding a new ISA = implementing the HAL, not
touching callers.

- [ ] Define `mon_hal` interface (NHL, `--forbid-asm --deny-unsafe`): `detect()`,
      `enter_root()`, `make_guest(state)`, `second_stage_map(gpa, hpa, perms)`,
      `protect_region(region, perms)`, `trap_on(event-set)`, `iommu_map(dev, buf,
      perms)`, `iommu_fault_handler()`, `status()`. Vendor back-ends register
      against it. `modeled`
- [ ] Capability probe that selects a back-end at boot and publishes the chosen
      tier + per-feature availability via `SYS_SYSINFO` (200..240 range, same
      fail-soft pattern as CET/SMAP/KPTI/TME rows). `modeled`
- [ ] Fallback contract: if `detect()` finds nothing, `mon_hal` reports
      `floor-only` and Track 6 runs unchanged on the software floor. `tested-tcg`

---

## G1 — privilege-below-ring-0 interposition (per vendor)

For each vendor: bring up the root/hypervisor mode, run the existing kernel as a
guest under an identity second-stage map (so behavior is unchanged), then trap the
events that would let a compromised ring-0 disable the Track 6 compartments
(writes to CR0.WP / CR3 / CR4, EFER, page-table roots, illegal privileged insns).

### Intel VT-x
- [ ] Detect: `CPUID.1:ECX.VMX[5]`, `IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL` lock + VMXON-outside-SMX;
      EPT/unrestricted-guest via `IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2`. `modeled`
- [ ] VMXON region; VMCS for kernel-as-guest (capture CR/GDT/IDT/TR/RIP/RSP/RFLAGS;
      host-state → monitor). `modeled`
- [ ] Identity **EPT**; VMLAUNCH; exit handler resumes transparently. Markers
      `HVX+`/`HVX!`. `tested-tcg` → `tested-accel`
- [ ] Trap CR0/CR4/CR3 writes + privileged insns that would disarm the floor. `tested-accel`

### AMD SVM (AMD-V)
- [ ] Detect: `CPUID 8000_0001:ECX.SVM[2]`; enable `EFER.SVME`; NPT via VMCB. `modeled`
      (extends the existing fme/SME detect scaffold.)
- [ ] VMCB for kernel-as-guest; identity **NPT**; `VMRUN`; `#VMEXIT` handler. `tested-tcg` → `tested-accel`
- [ ] Intercept CR/EFER writes + privileged insns. `tested-accel`

### ARM (AArch64) virtualization
- [ ] Detect EL2 availability / VHE (`ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1.VH`). `modeled`
- [ ] Run the kernel at EL1 under a monitor at EL2; identity **stage-2** translation
      (`VTTBR_EL2`/`VTCR_EL2`). `modeled` → `tested-accel`
- [ ] Trap via `HCR_EL2` (TVM/TRVM/privileged-access traps) the operations that
      would disable the floor. `tested-accel`

### RISC-V hypervisor extension
- [ ] Detect the H-extension (`misa` H bit / SBI). `modeled`
- [ ] Run the kernel in VS-mode under HS-mode monitor; identity **G-stage**
      (two-stage) translation (`hgatp`). `modeled` → `tested-accel`
- [ ] Trap supervisor CSR writes that would disarm the floor. `tested-accel`

### Cross-vendor
- [ ] Carve the monitor + every Track 6 compartment OUT of the guest's
      second-stage map (not RO — **not present**); negative test per vendor: guest
      read of a compartment page → second-stage violation exit. `tested-accel`
- [ ] EPT/NPT/stage-2/G-stage enforce W^X **independently of guest page tables**:
      guest clears WP + writes `.text` → second-stage violation, not a patch.
      `tested-accel` (per vendor) → `tested-hw`

## G2 — IOMMU / device-DMA confinement (per vendor)

Install DMA-remapping from the per-artifact `allowed DMA buffers` manifest field
(Track 2); device DMA outside its grant faults. Genuinely impossible in software.

- [ ] **Intel VT-d**: detect via ACPI DMAR; build root/context + 2nd-level page
      tables; per-device grants. `modeled` → `tested-hw`
- [ ] **AMD-Vi (AMD IOMMU)**: detect via ACPI IVRS; device table + page tables. `modeled` → `tested-hw`
- [ ] **ARM SMMUv3**: detect via ACPI IORT; stream table + per-StreamID grants. `modeled` → `tested-hw`
- [ ] **RISC-V IOMMU**: detect + device-context grants. `modeled` → `tested-hw`
- [ ] Route all four through the same `mon_hal.iommu_map`; the DMA-grant Track 6
      compartment (DMA-MON) is the only caller. `modeled`
- [ ] Negative test per vendor: a driver guest programming a DMA descriptor
      outside its granted buffer → IOMMU fault. `tested-hw` (TCG cannot; KVM partial).

## Compatibility matrix (track per vendor; do not blur)

| Guarantee | Intel | AMD | ARM | RISC-V | no-virt HW / TCG |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 root mode + identity 2nd-stage | VT-x+EPT | SVM+NPT | EL2 stage-2 | H-ext G-stage | floor-only (Track 6) |
| G1 trap floor-disable | VMCS CR-exit | VMCB intercept | HCR_EL2 | CSR trap | not enforceable in SW |
| G2 IOMMU DMA confinement | VT-d | AMD-Vi | SMMUv3 | RV IOMMU | **residual: undefended** |

"floor-only" / "residual: undefended" cells are the honest cost of running without
the hardware; STATUS.md §9 must name them.

## QEMU vs real-HW test boundary

TCG runs **none** of the root modes or IOMMUs. TCG-column results are `tested-tcg`
= logic-only (HAL dispatch, page-table math, manifest decode). VMLAUNCH/violations
need `tested-accel`; DMA faults need `tested-hw`. The verification entry point runs
the TCG-safe parts; the `-accel`/HW parts are a separate, explicitly-labeled run.

## Done definition for Track 5

- [ ] One `mon_hal` interface; ≥1 vendor back-end at `tested-accel`, the rest at
      `modeled`+`tested-tcg` with a clear path, all selectable at boot.
- [ ] G1: on every implemented vendor, the kernel runs as a guest and a compromised
      ring-0 cannot disable the Track 6 compartments (trap proven by negative test
      at `tested-accel`).
- [ ] G2: on every implemented vendor with an IOMMU, device DMA outside grant
      faults (`tested-hw`).
- [ ] On no-virt hardware and TCG the system is safe on the Track 6 floor; the two
      residuals (floor-disable, device DMA) are documented, not hidden.
- [ ] No capability claims a maturity tag it has not reached, per vendor.
