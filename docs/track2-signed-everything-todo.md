# Track 2 — Signed Everything (Beyond-Zero-Trust P0 keystone)

Goal: every artifact the system trusts arrives inside one canonical **signed
envelope**, and nothing unsigned, malformed, mis-targeted, expired, downgraded,
replayed, or wrong-role is ever accepted. This is what lets NexusOS exceed iOS on
the axis iOS does not cover: *no single key and no single component can mint
trusted state.*

Maps to `docs/nhl-beyond-zero-trust-todo.md` → "P0: Signed Everything",
"P0: Threshold Signing", and parts of "P1: Crypto / Parser / Schema Safety".
Spec: `docs/signed-artifact-envelope.md`.

## Status legend
- [x] done and verified green
- [~] partial / landed but incomplete
- [ ] not started

## Landed in this increment

- [x] Canonical envelope spec (`docs/signed-artifact-envelope.md`, v1).
- [x] Structural policy kernel `src/tools/security/signed_envelope.nxh`:
      magic, schema-version, type/domain range, strict-ascending (canonical +
      dedup) field ordering, in-bounds/no-overflow offsets, required-field
      bitmask per artifact class, composed `security_envelope_accept`.
- [x] Compiles `--target kernel --forbid-asm --deny-unsafe`.
- [x] Pass/fail fixtures + wired into `test_nhl_security_fixtures.ps1`,
      `test_nhl_security_guards.ps1`, and the no-asm module manifest.

## P0 — complete the envelope

- [x] The presence bitmask currently encodes the *mandatory* fields; add the
      `TARGET_DEVICE` semantics to `signed_artifact_check` (device / device-class
      match) so cross-device replay is rejected, not just structurally required.
- [x] Add a canonical-serialization predicate set so the *signed bytes* are
      unambiguous (tie envelope ↔ `schema_canonical_check`): reject non-minimal
      widths, duplicate TLV ids (already via ordering), and trailing garbage.
- [x] Add `security_envelope_payload_region_ok` to assert payload + signature
      block exactly tile `[header_len, total_len]` with no gaps/overlap.
- [x] Add a streaming/bounded verification contract: max envelope size, max
      field_count (have 64), max payload — all checked before allocation.
- [x] Constant-time comparison helper for hash/MAC equality (P1 crypto rule).

## P0 — threshold signing on top of the envelope

- [x] Define threshold policy per artifact class (boot accept, kernel/hypervisor
      activation, driver, app, policy, config, firmware, recovery, key rotation,
      key revocation) — `security_threshold_class_min_count` +
      `security_threshold_class_required_mask` + `security_threshold_class_quorum_ok`
      added to `src/tools/security/threshold_check.nxh` (2026-06-09).
- [x] `COSIGNER_ROLES` field must be cross-checked against the class threshold:
      reject if quorum/required roles unmet. DONE (2026-06-09):
      `envelope_reader.nxh` captures min_count/allowed_mask/required_mask from
      the COSIGNER_ROLES TLV and calls `security_threshold_class_quorum_ok`
      returning `ENVR_ERR_QUORUM = 21` on failure. Three new executable negative
      tests: `quorum_count_below_class_floor`, `quorum_missing_required_role`,
      `quorum_allowed_mask_too_narrow`.
- [x] Reject duplicate signers, wrong-role signers, threshold downgrade.
      `security_threshold_rule_valid` + `security_threshold_has_duplicate3` +
      `security_threshold_approves3` already in `threshold_check.nxh`.
      `quorum_allowed_mask_too_narrow` covers the downgrade case.
- [x] Quorum change requires BOTH old and new quorum approval.
      DONE (2026-06-10): `quorum_change_admit` + `boot_quorum_check` in
      `envelope_gate.nxh` — the gate keeps the ACTIVE per-class quorum table
      (init from the build-time class policy); a change arrives as a staged
      `\EFI\BOOT\KQUORUM.ENV` policy-class envelope (loader publishes at
      VBE_INFO+0xA0/0xA8) carrying an 18-byte `QCH1` payload (kind + old rule
      + new rule). Admission requires: fresh full Ed25519 verify (never the
      hash cache), declared old rule == active rule (stale/replayed change
      rejected, GATE_ERR_QCH_STATE=25), `security_threshold_rule_valid` +
      `security_threshold_change_valid` non-downgrade (required roles can only
      be added; GATE_ERR_QCH_RULE=26), and the verified signer-role set
      (`ed25519_last_verified_roles`) satisfying BOTH the old AND new quorum
      (GATE_ERR_QCH_APPROVAL=27). An accepted change RATCHETS: every later
      `artifact_gate_admit` checks the envelope's declared (signed,
      cache-keyed) quorum rule against the active table
      (GATE_ERR_QUORUM_RATCHET=28) — binding even on hash-cache hits.
      Verified: 11 host checks in `eval_ed25519.py` §8 + QEMU phases 5/6 of
      `test_track2_envelope_callsites.ps1` ("[QUORUM] accepted" /
      tampered -> "[QUORUM] rejected rc=" non-fatal / absent -> "[QUORUM]
      none").
- [x] Negative tests: one stolen key cannot authorize; one build server cannot
      release; one update server cannot ship; one recovery key cannot reset
      trust anchors. DONE (2026-06-10): `eval_ed25519.py` §7 — all four named
      scenarios as executable negatives through the real NHL
      `envelope_verify_signed` (single KERNEL key on a kernel artifact; one
      key's signature repeated 3x counts as one role; single build-server key
      on an app; single UPDATE key on an update; single RECOVERY key on a
      recovery artifact — all ENVR_ERR_SIGCRYPTO), plus the declared-rule
      forgery (min_count=1 below the class floor -> ENVR_ERR_QUORUM).

## P0 — reject matrix (every one needs a fail fixture)

DONE (2026-06-09): every row below is an **executable negative test**, not just
a declared fixture. `scripts/test/eval_envelope.py` builds each case as real
envelope bytes and interprets the actual in-kernel reader source
(`envelope_reader.nxh`, via the production compiler's parser with lb/lw/lq
mapped onto the blob), asserting the exact `ENVR_ERR_*` reason code. Wired into
`test_nhl_security_guards.ps1`; per-row `.fixture` files live in
`tests/security/fixtures/signed_envelope/` and are cross-checked against the
evaluator's case table so they cannot drift.

- [x] unsigned artifact
- [x] malformed envelope (bad magic / short / overflow offsets)
- [x] mismatched artifact type (app signature presented for kernel)
- [x] wrong target domain
- [x] wrong target device / device class
- [x] expired signature window (+ not-yet-valid)
- [x] stale revocation epoch
- [x] replayed artifact (rollback counter below required)
- [x] downgraded artifact (monotonic version below required)
- [x] valid signature from a role not authorized for the type
- [x] manifest/payload disagreement (hash mismatch, constant-control-flow compare)
- [x] missing required field per class (runnable-missing-policy-dep)
- [x] non-canonical / duplicate / descending field encoding
- [x] (extra) trailing garbage in TLV region; unknown critical field;
      partial / oversized signature block; bad field_count range

## P1 — host integration (the real producers/consumers)

- [x] Write a memory-safe host *envelope writer* (build-time) that emits v1
      envelopes for build outputs; keep it out of the running OS image.
      DONE (2026-06-09): `scripts/build/write_envelope.py` — CLI tool, produces
      canonical v1 envelopes with correct TLV ordering, per-class quorum defaults,
      and placeholder sig slots; output accepted by `envelope_verify` in the
      evaluator. Signature slots are 0x5A placeholders pending Ed25519 crypto.
- [x] Write the kernel/boot *envelope reader* that decodes TLVs and calls the
      NHL predicates — this is what turns "checker exists" into "system enforces".
      DONE (2026-06-09): `src/kernel/nexushlk/envelope_reader.nxh`
      (`envelope_verify`) — zero-asm, bounds-checked byte walk, distinct
      `ENVR_ERR_*` reason code per reject-matrix row; pinned the v1 TLV wire
      encoding + `payload_len` header field in `docs/signed-artifact-envelope.md`;
      compiled into the kernel image alongside `signed_envelope.nxh` +
      `signed_artifact_check.nxh` (same sources the host fixture gate compiles,
      so contract and enforcement cannot drift). NOT yet bound to a boot/update
      call site, and signature *crypto* (threshold Ed25519 over the canonical
      bytes) is still open — the reader binds the signed HASH field to a
      caller-computed payload SHA-256.
- [x] Bind envelope verification into the boot chain (P1 Boot Chain track).
      DONE (2026-06-10): `src/kernel/nexushlk/envelope_gate.nxh` —
      `artifact_gate_admit` (the single admission entry point; computes the
      payload SHA-256 itself via crypto.nxh and calls `envelope_verify_signed`)
      + `syssig_verify_boot`, called from kmain at K5. The UEFI loader reads
      `\EFI\BOOT\SYSSIG.ENV` (built + DEV-quorum-signed every build by
      build_uefi.ps1 step 2a3 via write_envelope.py) and publishes (base,size)
      at VBE_INFO+0x80/0x88; the kernel FAIL-CLOSED panics ('SSG0'..'SSG3') if
      the envelope is missing, rejected, or its payload is not byte-identical
      to the in-image per-app integrity table — which transitively covers
      every app segment hash, so no app code runs without threshold
      signatures. The gate also pins the call site's artifact class
      (GATE_ERR_CALLER_TYPE = 23: a validly signed envelope of the wrong
      class is inadmissible).
- [x] Bind envelope verification into the update path (P1 Update System track).
      DONE (2026-06-10): `boot_update_check` (same module, kmain K5) — the
      loader reads OPTIONAL `\EFI\BOOT\KUPDATE.ENV` (VBE_INFO+0x90/0x98); the
      verdict comes ONLY from `artifact_gate_admit` (type=update, class
      quorum 3-of roles BOOT+KERNEL+UPDATE) and is latched + logged
      "[UPDATE] accepted|rejected rc=N|none". Staging/commit of an accepted
      artifact is the next Update System increment; until then no other path
      accepts update input, so unsigned update input is unreachable.
- [x] Cache verified immutable artifacts by hash (perf gate).
      DONE (2026-06-10): 8-entry round-robin cache in envelope_gate.nxh keyed
      by the SHA-256 of the ENTIRE envelope byte range (header+payload+sigs);
      a hit skips only the Ed25519 crypto — structure + context-dependent
      semantics (window/device/anti-rollback) are re-checked on every admit;
      only accepted envelopes are inserted. Proven on host (eval_ed25519
      gate suite: hit/miss counters) and in-kernel (QEMU "[SYSSIG] ok c=1").
- [ ] Residuals for full "no unsigned input anywhere": the loader does not
      yet envelope-verify KERNEL.BIN itself (pre-kernel stage; needs the
      verifier ported into the loader or a measured handoff); the gate's
      verifier context pins now=1 / device_id=1 / floors=1 (RTC wallclock
      binding + persistent anti-rollback counters are open); driver/config/
      policy artifact classes have no loaded artifacts yet.

### Verification (call-site binding)

- Host: `scripts/test/eval_ed25519.py` sections 5–6 (run by
  `test_nhl_security_guards.ps1`) — transpiles crypto.nxh + envelope_gate.nxh
  with the production frontend and exercises admit/cache/wrong-class/
  fail-closed-panic/update-latch paths (15 checks).
- QEMU end-to-end: `scripts/test/test_track2_envelope_callsites.ps1` — 4
  boots: signed accept (+ in-kernel cache hit), tampered SYSSIG fail-closed
  (no [/BOOTTIME]), signed KUPDATE accepted, tampered KUPDATE rejected
  non-fatally. All 13 checks green 2026-06-10.

### Gotcha: stale `ram_amnesiac.asm` breaks sig-coverage

If `ram_amnesiac.asm` (or any other stale raw-asm shim that was not migrated
to zero-asm NHLK) is still present in the build, it will be included in the
kernel image outside the envelope's signed coverage. The envelope's HASH field
covers only the canonically-assembled payload bytes; any unsigned bytes that
execute at ring-0 break the "signed everything" invariant. **Audit the build
manifest after any new raw-asm file appears; the `--forbid-asm` gate catches
new violations at compile time but does not retroactively flag stale files that
were already excluded from the NHLK build.**

## P1 — fuzzing & parser safety

- [x] Fuzz the envelope decoder (malformed TLV, length overflow, deep nesting,
      duplicate/critical-unknown fields, path traversal in bundle names).
      DONE (2026-06-10): `scripts/test/fuzz_envelope.py` — structure-aware
      mutators (15 classes: byte flips, truncation, header/length extremes,
      duplicate/dropped/shuffled fields, unknown critical ids incl.
      path-traversal value blobs, non-minimal widths, wrong value lengths,
      sig-block games, field_count lies, splices) + raw random blobs, run
      against the REAL interpreted `envelope_verify` (same eval_envelope.py
      interpreter over production NHL source). Safety invariants per input:
      the blob is placed at the END of interpreter memory so ANY
      out-of-bounds load raises (verified to fire on a planted mid-TLV
      truncation with a lying total_len); bounded-loop cap; result must be a
      defined ENVR_* code. Deterministic seed; `--seed/--iters` to explore.
      Wired into `test_nhl_security_guards.ps1`.
- [x] Differential test: two independent decoders agree on accept/reject.
      DONE (2026-06-10): clean-room Python `ref_verify` in fuzz_envelope.py
      (written from docs/signed-artifact-envelope.md + the policy tables, not
      the reader's control flow) compared against the kernel reader on every
      corpus + fuzz input (54 valid envelopes across all 9 artifact classes ×
      domains × target kinds, plus all fuzz inputs). No splits across 3 seeds
      / ~9.5k inputs; detection plumbing meta-tested with a planted
      always-accept ref.
- [x] Property test: canonicalize(decode(x)) == x for all accepted envelopes.
      DONE (2026-06-10): every accepted envelope is decoded to fields and
      re-emitted through the canonical writer; byte-identical or the suite
      fails (meta-tested with a planted non-minimal-width encoding).

## Done definition for Track 2

- [~] Every trusted artifact is a signed v1 envelope; unsigned input is impossible
      to accept anywhere in boot/kernel/update. (2026-06-10: boot-chain +
      update-path call sites are BOUND to `envelope_verify_signed` via
      envelope_gate.nxh — app code is covered transitively through the signed
      integrity table, and update input has no non-gate path. Remaining for
      [x]: loader-side KERNEL.BIN envelope verification, RTC/now binding,
      persistent anti-rollback floors — see "Residuals" above.)
- [x] Every entry in the reject matrix has a passing negative test.
      (28 cases including 3 new quorum cases; all green 2026-06-09.)
- [x] Threshold quorum is enforced from the `COSIGNER_ROLES` field per class.
      (Structural quorum policy enforced at parse time via
      `security_threshold_class_quorum_ok`; actual Ed25519 multi-sig crypto
      LANDED 2026-06-10 — see below.)
- [x] **Real Ed25519 threshold-signature verification** (2026-06-10):
      `src/kernel/nexushlk/ed25519_check.nxh` — zero-asm RFC 8032 verify
      (SHA-512, mod-2^255-19 field arithmetic over 32-bit digits, point
      decompression, [S]B == R + [h]A) compiled into the kernel image
      (`--forbid-asm`, build green, QEMU boot healthy).
      `envelope_verify_signed` = `envelope_verify` (structure+semantics) AND
      `ed25519_envelope_sigs_ok`: every 64-byte signature in the detached
      block is checked against the allowed threshold-role public keys over
      the canonical bytes [0, header_len+payload_len); a role counts at most
      once; accept iff >= min_count distinct allowed roles verified AND all
      required roles verified, else `ENVR_ERR_SIGCRYPTO` (22).
      Host side: `scripts/build/ed25519_host.py` (pure-Python RFC 8032) +
      `write_envelope.py --sign-roles` emits REAL quorum signatures (DEV keys
      from fixed seeds; production re-bakes `ed_role_pubs` from HSM keys).
      Tested by `scripts/test/eval_ed25519.py` (real NHL source through the
      production nxhc frontend, transpiled): RFC 8032 TEST 1-3 + tamper/
      malleability negatives, SHA-512 vs hashlib differential, pubkey-drift
      guard, and envelope accept / tampered-sig / placeholder / under-quorum /
      missing-required-role rejects. Wired into test_nhl_security_guards.ps1.
- [x] A memory-safe writer produces, and an in-OS reader verifies, real envelopes.
      (`scripts/build/write_envelope.py` writer + `envelope_reader.nxh` reader;
      round-trip verified via `eval_envelope.py`.)
- [x] No single stolen key authorizes any critical action *at the envelope
      layer* (2026-06-10): `envelope_verify_signed` requires >= class-floor
      distinct role keys (real Ed25519) with all class-required roles present;
      one key can contribute at most one role. Verified negatively
      (under-quorum and missing-required-role envelopes reject with
      ENVR_ERR_SIGCRYPTO). System-wide closure still needs the boot/update
      call sites to be bound to `envelope_verify_signed` (P1 above) so no
      unsigned path remains.
