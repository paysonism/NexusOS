# NHL Beyond-Zero-Trust TODO

> **Map of all docs: `docs/TODO-INDEX.md` (read it first).** This master list
> LAGS the `trackN-*.md` docs where they overlap — on a conflict the track doc

This is the master TODO for the new NHL-only security architecture. "NHL" here
means NexusHL/NexusHLK source and toolchain work only. This plan intentionally
does not accept new `.asm`, `.inc`, generated assembly include files, or inline
assembly escape hatches for the new trusted path.

The design target is stronger than ordinary zero trust: compromise of one
kernel partition, hypervisor partition, signing key, build service, update
service, driver, app, or operator path must not be enough to compromise the
whole system, leak private data, or authorize persistent malicious state.

## Active Track Plans

Per-track working plans (with their own granular TODOs and verified increments):

- `docs/track1-repo-enforcement-todo.md` — P0 repository enforcement.
- `docs/track2-signed-everything-todo.md` — P0 signed-everything keystone.
- `docs/track3-sel4-validity-todo.md` — P2 seL4 validity / invariants.
- `docs/track4-ram-anti-forensic-todo.md` — RAM-only / amnesiac execution +
  best-effort anti-forensic memory (threat-model expansion: snapshot/RAM-dump
  attacker, with the irreducible software residual documented).

Single verification entry point for all of the above:
`scripts/test/test_nhl_security_guards.ps1` (privacy + no-asm + inventory +
policy-module compile + checker fixtures + seL4 invariants).

The "Extended Hardening" sections at the bottom of this file capture work that
goes *beyond* the original program (toolchain trust, proof depth, TCB reduction,
transparency/attestation, crypto agility/PQC, side-channel, continuous assurance,
data-at-rest). They are not yet split into their own track docs.

## Global Non-Negotiables

- [ ] Treat all new security work as NHL/NexusHLK-only.
- [ ] Block new `.asm` files in the active implementation path.
- [ ] Block new `.inc` files in the active implementation path.
- [ ] Block inline `asm`, `asm {}`, textual instruction injection, and compiler
      escape hatches.
- [ ] Block generated assembly include files as a supported interface.
- [ ] Keep legacy assembly only as quarantined migration input until replaced.
- [ ] Require every new module to compile with `--forbid-asm`.
- [ ] Require security-critical modules to compile with `--deny-unsafe`.
- [ ] Allow unsafe capabilities only at named hardware boundaries.
- [ ] Require unsafe boundaries to be tiny, documented, reviewed, and tested.
- [ ] Make the default compiler behavior fail closed for unknown targets,
      unknown intrinsics, unknown signer roles, unknown policy fields, and
      unknown artifact types.
- [ ] Prefer typed compiler intrinsics over opaque low-level escape mechanisms.
- [ ] Keep each feature fast by design: bounded parsing, bounded verification,
      no hidden network waits, no unbounded allocation, no quadratic policy
      checks in hot paths.
- [ ] Keep each feature maintainable by design: schema versioning, generated
      validators, central policy definitions, narrow stable APIs, and no need
      to update most apps for one kernel/security change.

      (`tools/security/legacy_asm_inventory.txt` lists all 181 files + enforces
      monotonic shrink; owner/risk/replacement columns still TODO — see Track 1.)
- [ ] Add CI output that reports "NHL-only trusted path: pass/fail".
- [ ] Add CI output that reports "legacy assembly quarantine unchanged:
      pass/fail".

      files.

## Extended Hardening (Beyond The Original Program)

Additions that push past the original tracks. Grouped by theme; priority noted
per section. None started unless marked.

### P0/P1: Toolchain Trust (defeat "trusting trust")
The whole posture assumes the compiler and build tools are honest; nothing yet
verifies that. Largest unaddressed surface.

- [ ] Bootstrappable build: compile the NHL toolchain from a minimal auditable
      seed so a backdoored binary compiler cannot silently persist.
- [ ] Diverse double-compilation (DDC): build via two independent toolchains/
      paths and prove the outputs converge.
- [ ] Bit-for-bit reproducible full images a third party can independently
      rebuild and confirm against a published digest (extend the A/B ORG passes).
- [ ] Pin + hash every build input (the assembler, the NHL toolchain
      interpreter, build scripts); verify before use.
- [ ] Emit a machine-readable SBOM for the OS image.
- [ ] Proof-carrying codegen / translation validation: prove emitted NASM
      preserves NHL source semantics for security-critical modules.

### P2: Proof Depth (beyond authority-bitmask invariants)
- [ ] Non-interference / information-flow proof: no data flows between app slots
      except through an explicit shared handle (proven, not modeled).
- [ ] Constant-time verification as a CI gate over secret-handling asm
      (kernel_canary, l3_slot_key[], blob-signing key, HMAC paths) — make CT a
      checked property, not a hand-applied one.
- [ ] Bounded model-check the syscall dispatch state machine for any path that
      dispatches without all gates (cap -> allowlist -> rate -> validate -> perm).
- [ ] Mutation-test the security regression suite: prove it fails when a
      mitigation is broken.

### P1: TCB Reduction / True Partitioning
- [ ] Privilege-separate drivers / net / fs into ring-3 partitions with
      capability IPC (not ambient kernel calls).
- [ ] Measure and publish the TCB size; CI fails on TCB growth.
- [ ] User-space reference monitor for policy decisions, outside the monolith.

### P1: Transparency & Attestation
- [ ] Binary transparency log (append-only Merkle / Rekor-style) for releases.
- [ ] Remote attestation protocol over mb_digest: nonce challenge -> signed quote.
- [ ] Hash-chain the cap_audit_ring so the §4 capability-transition log is
      tamper-evident (cannot be silently truncated/rewritten).

### P1: Crypto Agility & Post-Quantum
- [ ] PQC artifact-signature option (SPHINCS+ / ML-DSA) in the signed envelope —
      leverages the existing quantum entropy seed (qrng_seed).
- [ ] Key hierarchy + rotation + forward secrecy; per-boot ephemeral keys.
- [ ] Threshold / Shamir-split signing keys (key material never fully assembled).
- [ ] RNG health checks before every key/nonce draw (enforce the P1 rule on
      kernel_canary_init / l3_boot_nonce).

### P1: Side-Channel & Micro-Architectural
- [ ] Audit every indirect branch for Spectre-v2 coverage (prove the lfence set
      is complete); consider retpoline-style thunks.
- [ ] Cross-slot cache/timing isolation (flush or partition on slot switch).
- [ ] SSB / MDS mitigations where portable.
- [ ] Timer-driven ASLR re-randomization (shrink the leak-then-exploit window).

### P1: Continuous Adversarial Assurance
- [ ] Coverage-guided fuzzing of the envelope decoder, policy parser, syscall
      validators, and XML/SVG parsers, wired into CI (not one-shot).
- [ ] Symbolic execution of sc_validate_from_table and the path canonicalizer.
- [ ] One fail-closed PoC per landed mitigation in -SecurityRegression.

### P1: Data-at-Rest & Secret Hygiene
- [ ] Per-install keyed FS encryption (l3_slot_key) so a copied DATA.IMG is not
      plaintext (within the non-physical threat model).
- [ ] Zeroize transient secrets after use everywhere (HMAC scratch, key
      derivation buffers, decrypted pages).
- [ ] Secure-delete semantics for the FS.

  variant of this work.

### P1: Hardware Memory Encryption (opportunistic — detect + enable, no-op if absent)
Transparent memory-controller AES so a cold-boot / physical-DIMM / DMA-of-DRAM
capture is ciphertext. Same scaffold pattern as CET/SMAP/KPTI (detect always
compiled, enable gated, status via SYS_SYSINFO). Full detail + MSR/CPUID specifics
in `docs/track4-ram-anti-forensic-todo.md` Part C.

- [x] **Intel TME** detect (CPUID.7.0.ECX[13]; IA32_TME_ACTIVATE MSR 0x982 bit 1
      = enabled / bit 0 = locked) — OS detects + asserts (BIOS enables+locks).
- [ ] **Intel TME-MK** per-KeyID separation → maps onto the per-slot key model.
- [~] **AMD SME** detect (CPUID 0x8000001F EAX[0]; C-bit = EBX[5:0]; enable via
      SYSCFG MSR 0xC0010010 bit 23) + opportunistic per-page C-bit on
      kernel-secret / slot / FS-cache pages.
- [ ] **AMD SEV / SEV-ES / SEV-SNP** + **Intel TDX** detect — confidential-VM
      tier; only if NexusOS runs as a guest or hosts VMs. Decide whether to target
      running as a confidential guest (cheapest path to true whole-memory opacity
      on cloud hardware).
- [x] Caveat doc: QEMU TCG does NOT emulate TME/SME — verifiable only on real
      silicon (or KVM+SEV); the software at-rest layer is what TCG `pmemsave` tests.

### P0/P1: Kill-Chain Defense (make iOS-class chains unreachable AND unusable)
Canonical design + per-stage matrix in `docs/architecture-defense-in-depth.md`.
Core invariant: every kill-chain stage is gated by a DIFFERENT, smaller, lower
component the attacker has not compromised and cannot reach. Stratify enforcers so
compromise of stage N yields nothing for N+1.

Stage gates to build (net-new beyond today's software floor):
- [ ] **User-space drivers**: move drivers out of the kernel into sandboxed
      processes with default-deny caps (drivers are in-kernel today). A driver
      holds NO direct I/O / kernel R/W.
- [ ] **Safe-proxy reference-monitor layer**: a driver/app reaches I/O, kernel
      R/W, or the monitor ONLY via a capability-bound request to a minimal proxy
      that re-derives authority from the CALLER's identity (no confused deputy).
- [ ] **One-shot ephemeral parser workers**: every untrusted-input decode
      (image/font/XML/SVG/packet) runs in a fresh near-zero-authority worker
      killed after one operation (kills the long-lived-daemon corruption class).
- [ ] **Opportunistic separation-monitor / hypervisor tier** above the always-on
      nk_monitor floor: VT-x/AMD-V + IOMMU when present for raw memory/IO/DMA
      gating; nk_monitor + mmio_bounds.inc when absent (detect+enable pattern).
- [ ] **Monitor-checked attested request trail**: privileged actions carry a
      provenance chain the monitor re-validates; a subverted kernel partition
      cannot forge it (it lacks the monitor key), so its grant is refused.
- [ ] **Threshold authority for dangerous runtime ops** (make-page-executable,
      grant-DMA, load-policy): no single partition authorizes — runtime
      co-approval (Track 2 threshold applied to operations, not just artifacts).
- [ ] **Information-flow labels**: no flow from a secret region to an exfil sink
      without a declassifier (extends the Track 3 non-interference invariant).
- [ ] **Shared-memory attested descriptor rings** for hot driver paths (validate
      the batch once; session-bound MACs after one-time setup; no per-op crypto)
      so the user-space-driver model keeps NIC/xHCI/framebuffer throughput.
- [ ] **Quarantine-and-restart** (MINIX-3-style) for any failed/over-budget/
      crashed component, with recovery authority in a separate partition, so
      fail-closed never means system-wedged.
- [ ] **Per-stage negative tests**: for each kill-chain row, a test that performs
      the stage-N compromise and proves stage N+1 is still independently blocked
      (the concrete proof that the chain cannot progress).
