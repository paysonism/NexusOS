# Track 1 — Repository Enforcement (Beyond-Zero-Trust P0)

Goal: make "the trusted path is NHL/NexusHLK-only" a property the repository
*enforces*, not a property we hope holds. This is the cheap, load-bearing track:
without it the no-asm posture rots silently as files are added.

Maps to `docs/nhl-beyond-zero-trust-todo.md` → "P0: Repository Enforcement" and
`docs/agent-nhl-no-asm-audit.md` → "Phase 1: freeze and inventory".

## Status legend
- [x] done and verified green
- [~] partial / landed but incomplete
- [ ] not started

## Landed in this increment

- [x] Freeze the legacy `.asm`/`.inc` surface in a manifest
      (`tools/security/legacy_asm_inventory.txt`, 181 entries, 2026-06-04).
- [x] New-file guard: `check_no_asm.ps1 -InventoryGuard` fails on any active
      `.asm`/`.inc` not listed in the inventory.
- [x] Monotonic-shrink guard: a listed file that no longer exists is reported as
      a stale entry so the inventory can only shrink as migration deletes legacy.
- [x] Wire the inventory guard into the verification entry point
      (`scripts/test/test_nhl_security_guards.ps1`).
- [x] Baseline is green (no new/stale entries against the current tree).

## P0 — finish repository enforcement

- [x] Record per-entry metadata. The manifest is a structured pipe-delimited
      format (`path | subsystem | risk | status | replacement`); the guard parses
      the path column and rejects malformed lines (negative-tested). `replacement`
      is now filled and `status` flipped to `migrating` for every legacy file with
      a started `.nxh` counterpart (kernel: syscall_security/validation/support/
      data.inc, usermode_callbacks/integrity.inc, window.asm, usb_hid.asm; user:
      about/settings/shell.inc). Files with no genuinely-knowable target stay
      `legacy`/TBD — not invented.
- [x] Add a guard rule that fails on `%include "*.asm"` / `%include "*.inc"`
      appearing in any **new-architecture** build script, allowing only the
      quarantined legacy build graph (`kernel_build.asm`, `apps.asm`,
      `build_bios.ps1`, `build_uefi.ps1`, `build_nxh.ps1`, plus the legacy NASM
      verification harnesses test_nxhc_security.ps1 / boot_parity.ps1). Also fails
      on `nasm`/`-f bin` in a non-legacy build script.
      (`tools/security/check_build_integrity.ps1`, rule `new-arch-build-asm-include`.)
- [x] Add a guard rule that fails when a generated `build/nxh/**/*.asm` or
      `build/nxh/generated_apps.inc` is `%include`'d as a source of truth by any
      file other than the two legacy aggregators.
      (`tools/security/check_build_integrity.ps1`, rule `generated-artifact-as-source`.)
- [x] Add a raw instruction-emitter-string guard: fail on bare NASM mnemonic/reg
      text in `.nxh` outside the compiler backend allowlist (`nxhc.py`).
      (`tools/security/check_nhl_presubmit.ps1`, rule `nxh-raw-emitter-string`.)
- [x] Add presubmit: reject new public APIs exposed through `.inc` include files
      (global/%define/%macro/EXPORT in a `.inc` not already frozen in the
      inventory). (`check_nhl_presubmit.ps1`, rule `inc-public-api`.)
- [x] Add presubmit: reject undocumented compiler intrinsics — every intrinsic
      nxhc.py registers in `_NULLARY_INTRINSICS` must be in the guard's frozen
      documented-intrinsic allowlist (freeze pattern, like the legacy inventory).
      (`check_nhl_presubmit.ps1`, rule `undocumented-intrinsic`.)
- [x] Add presubmit: reject security modules without a threat note header
      (no security-reasoning comment in a policy module's first 14 lines).
      (`check_nhl_presubmit.ps1`, rule `missing-threat-note`.)
- [x] Add presubmit: reject release logging calls in security/policy/crypto
      modules — a serial/console sink at release scope (outside a
      `cfg "ENABLE_*"` debug-gated block).
      (`check_nhl_presubmit.ps1`, rule `release-logging-in-security`.)
- [x] Add presubmit: reject raw user data in log/trace format strings.
      (`check_nhl_presubmit.ps1`, rule `raw-user-data-in-log`.)

## P0 — CI surfacing

- [x] Emit a single line `NHL-only trusted path: pass/fail`
      (`scripts/test/ci_security_summary.ps1`, driven by the entry-point exit).
- [x] Emit a single line `legacy assembly quarantine unchanged: pass/fail`
      (diff inventory vs. tree; fail on additions, allow deletions —
      `ci_security_summary.ps1` treats only new/missing/malformed findings as
      failure, allowing `stale-inventory-entry` deletions).
- [x] Fail CI if new `.asm`/`.inc`/`.s` appear in `build/`, `dist/`, or active
      source after a new-architecture build runs (dirty-output guard:
      `scripts/test/ci_dirty_output_guard.ps1`, snapshot/compare).
- [x] Run the inventory guard in CI on every PR, not just locally
      (`.github/workflows/nhl-security.yml`, on `pull_request` + push).

## Enforcement-shape correctness (don't inherit the old architecture)

- [x] Split the guards into **legacy-maintenance** mode and **new-architecture**
      mode so the new path cannot silently inherit assembly assumptions. The
      build-integrity guard defines an EXPLICIT legacy-maintenance allowlist (the
      legacy build scripts + aggregators); everything else is new-architecture and
      may not introduce nasm/`-f bin`/`%include "*.asm/*.inc"`.
      (`tools/security/check_build_integrity.ps1`.)
- [x] Make `deprecated/` archival-only: fail if anything under `deprecated/` is
      imported/included/compiled/linked or named as a source by an active
      (non-deprecated) tracked file.
      (`tools/security/check_build_integrity.ps1`, rule `deprecated-import`.)

## Tests for the enforcement itself (meta-tests)

- [x] Negative test: planting a new `src/**/foo.asm` makes `-InventoryGuard` fail.
      (`scripts/test/test_enforcement_meta.ps1`, test 1.)
- [x] Negative test: a bogus inventory entry for a missing file makes the guard
      report a stale entry (automated fixture, self-restoring).
      (`scripts/test/test_enforcement_meta.ps1`, test 2.)
- [x] Negative test: a bad `%include`/`nasm` in a new build script fails the
      build-integrity guard.
      (`scripts/test/test_enforcement_meta.ps1`, test 3.)
- [x] Property test: the guard's file enumeration reaches untracked working-tree
      files — the planted `src/**/foo.asm` in test 1 is never committed, proving
      an untracked `.asm` cannot sneak through.
      (`scripts/test/test_enforcement_meta.ps1`, tests 1+4.)

## Done definition for Track 1

- [x] No new trusted-path `.asm`/`.inc` can be added without an explicit,
      reviewed inventory edit. (inventory guard + CI additions-only check)
- [x] The inventory only shrinks; growth requires a documented justification.
      (monotonic-shrink guard + CI quarantine-unchanged line)
- [x] CI reports trusted-path and quarantine status on every PR.
      (`.github/workflows/nhl-security.yml` + `ci_security_summary.ps1`)
- [x] Generated assembly can never be treated as source of truth.
      (`check_build_integrity.ps1` generated-artifact-as-source rule)
- [x] All enforcement has its own negative tests.
      (`test_enforcement_meta.ps1`, 5/5 green)
